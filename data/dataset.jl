A runny nose, sputum, dry cough and pneumonia can be symptoms of COVID-19 however not everyone infected with the disease will have them. Disease expert Professor Collignon says temperatures around 26 to 27 degrees C won't kill the virus; however, UV light from the sun can be effective in drying out the virus. Understanding of how long COVID-19 survives on surfaces is limited, with the WHO referring to previous studies of other viruses to estimate a range of a few hours to a few days. Drinking warm water, avoiding iced drinks and gargling warm salt water are not treatments or preventions, but staying hydrated is important and gargling may relieve sore throats. The timeline for progression of COVID-19 symptoms is partly accurate but not everyone will experience all of these symptoms or in that order. The  delicate tissues behind the nose are likely starting points.", "country": "Australia", "date": "2020/03/13", "keywords":[]}
